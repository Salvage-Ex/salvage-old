macOS Build Instructions and Notes

The commands in this guide should be executed in a Terminal application. The built-in one is located in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app.
Preparation

Install the macOS command line tools:

xcode-select --install

When the popup appears, click Install.

Then install Homebrew.
Dependencies

brew install automake berkeley-db4 libtool boost miniupnpc openssl pkg-config protobuf python qt libevent qrencode

See dependencies.md for a complete overview.

If you want to build the disk image with make deploy (.dmg / optional), you need RSVG

brew install librsvg

Berkeley DB

It is recommended to use Berkeley DB 4.8. If you have to build it yourself, you can use the installation script included in contrib/ like so

./contrib/install_db4.sh .

from the root of the repository.

Note: You only need Berkeley DB if the wallet is enabled (see the section Disable-Wallet mode below).
Build Salvage Core

    Clone the Salvage Core source code and cd into salvage

     git clone https://github.com/Salvage-Ex/salvage.git
     cd salvage

    Build Salvage Core:

    Configure and build the headless Salvage Core binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).

    You can disable the GUI build by passing --without-gui to configure.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

    It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:

    make check

    You can also create a .dmg that contains the .app bundle (optional):

    make deploy

Running

Salvage Core is now available at ./src/salvaged

Before running, it's recommended that you create an RPC configuration file.

echo -e "rpcuser=salvagerpc\nrpcpassword=$(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)" > "/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/Salvage/salvage.conf"

chmod 600 "/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/Salvage/salvage.conf"

The first time you run salvaged, it will start downloading the blockchain. This process could take several hours.

You can monitor the download process by looking at the debug.log file:

tail -f $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Salvage/debug.log

Other commands:

./src/salvaged -daemon # Starts the salvage daemon.
./src/salvage-cli --help # Outputs a list of command-line options.
./src/salvage-cli help # Outputs a list of RPC commands when the daemon is running.

Notes

    Tested on OS X 10.10 Yosemite through macOS 10.13 High Sierra on 64-bit Intel processors only.

    Building with downloaded Qt binaries is not officially supported. See the notes in #7714
